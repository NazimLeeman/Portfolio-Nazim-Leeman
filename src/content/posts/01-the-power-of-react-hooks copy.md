## Key Features

> *Static Site Generation:* Astro leverages static site generation, which means that most of your site's content is pre-built at build time. This approach eliminates the need for client-side rendering (CSR) for every page, reducing the initial load time and improving SEO.
> *Universal Rendering:* Astro supports universal rendering, which means you can mix and match rendering strategies on a per-component basis. You can choose between static generation, server rendering, or client rendering depending on your project's requirements.
> *Zero JS:* Astro can render pages with no JavaScript, making it possible to create highly accessible websites that work well with assistive technologies and on low-powered devices.
